# Password-Generator

## Homework #3

The random password generator combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate a random password for the user. 

To begin, the user clicks "generate password." They can then choose the number of characters in their password, as well as whether or not they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters in their password. They are guaranteed to have at least one of each type of character they select.

After the password is generated, they can click to copy the password.

To run the program, open it in a browser.
